## Redux is a libarary for JavaScript application

- Redux is not tied to React.
- Can be used with React, Angular, Vue or even vanilla Javascript.

## Rudux is a state container

- Redux stores the state of your application
- React app - state of a component
- State of an app is the state represented by all the individual components of that app
- Redux will store and manage the application state

## Using Redux in React?

Redux will help manage state in our application. Instead of having the root app component hold the state and pass as props, the component that holds the state will pass by communicating with redux state container.

Other React state management :

    React context - prevent prop drilling.
    React Hooks - useContext + useReducer
